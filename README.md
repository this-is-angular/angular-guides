# This is Angular guides
Welcome to the Angular guides by the This is Angular community of public tech
contributors.

These guides will be published for free by This is Angular.

## Content
A lot of suggestions for guides, topics and resources have already been added
to this repository. Currently, we would like to focus on getting [the Angular
fundamentals guides](./fundamentals/index.md) done first. This will help us put
our name out there as a source of good Angular content.

*Suggested topics* are only that: **suggestions** from editors. *Suggested
resources* are not necessarily meant to be added as links in the guide itself.
They are meant to be used as an inspiration for writing the guide. *Notes* are
notes abouts suggested topics.

## Editors
Our editor is [Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen](https://github.com/LayZeeDK). Reach out to me if you need help with your content or
want to start contributing.

## Style guide
We don't yet have an official style guide. Use [freeCodeCamp's style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-guide-articles.md)
as a starting point.

## Graphics
For now, add simple mockup images of charts, diagrams, and illustrations without
detailed styling. We'll figure out common styling later.

## Writer's guide
For inspiration on writing tech articles and guides, look at our [Technical
writer's guide](./technical-writers-guide.md).
