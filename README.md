# This is Angular guides

Welcome to the open learning This is Angular guides by the This is Angular community of public tech
contributors.

We welcome contributions of any type or size üëê

## Content

A lot of suggestions for guides, topics and resources have already been added
to this repository. Currently, we would like to focus on getting [the Angular
fundamentals guides](./docs/fundamentals) done first.

_Suggested topics_ are only that: **suggestions** from editors. _Suggested
resources_ are not necessarily meant to be added as links in the guide itself.
They are meant to be used as an inspiration for writing the guide. _Notes_ are
notes abouts suggested topics.

## Editors

Our editor is [Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen](https://github.com/LayZeeDK). Reach out to me if you need help with your content or
want to start contributing.

## Style guide

We don't yet have an official style guide. Use [freeCodeCamp's style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-guide-articles.md)
as a starting point.

## Graphics

For now, add simple mockup images of charts, diagrams, and illustrations without
detailed styling. We'll figure out common styling later.

## Writer's guide

For inspiration on writing tech articles and guides, look at our [Technical
writer's guide](./technical-writers-guide.md).
