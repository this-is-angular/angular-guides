# Angular In Depth guides
Welcome to the Angular In Depth guides for In Depth Education.

These guides will be published for free by In Depth Education once we have a
Ghost-based website.

## License
By contributing to these guides, you agree to give ownership of the content to
In Depth Education, a for-profit organization. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the
details. Your name will be mentioned on the guides you help author.

## Content
A lot of suggestions for guides, topics and resources have already been added
to this repository. Currently, we would like to focus on getting [the basic
fundamentals guides](./fundamentals/angular-fundamentals.md) done first. This
will help us put our name out there as a source of quality guides for Angular
development.

## Editors
Our editors are Tim Descryver and Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen. Reach out to them
if you need help with your content or want to start contributing.

# Style guide
We don't yet have an official style guide. Use [freeCodeCamp's style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-guide-articles.md)
as a starting point.

# Graphics
For now, add simple mockup images of charts, diagrams, and illustrations without
detailed styling. We'll figure out common styling later.
