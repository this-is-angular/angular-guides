# Technical writer's guide

# The title

* Spend time on a good title.
* Choose a good picture.

# The beginning

* The most important sentence in any article is the first one.
* Present you article so it induces the reader to continue reading.

# Be effective with your words

* Avoid Redundant Phrases
* Simplify, simplify
* Review & Re-write lots of times. 
* Get rid of all the clutter.

# Be Explicit, Be Clear

* Donâ€™t assume that your readers know what you assume everybody knows.
* Don't assume that they still remember what was once explained to them.

# The ending

Next to the beginning this is the most important part. You should give almost as
much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first.
What usually works best is a quotation. Go back through your notes to find some
remark that has a sense of finality, or that's funny, or that adds an unexpected
closing detail. 
A good ending gives the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over.
